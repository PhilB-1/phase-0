# Reflections

## Think About Time

Being in this program has really caused me to rethink both how I manage my time and how I use my time. My system was to make a schedule of day or days incorporating everything I needed to do in big chunks with enough time to complete the entire task. This helped keep me to a schedule, but it was not one I could easily keep or I might become bored of working on something before I was able to move on to the next task. Even recently I have even falling away from these practices which has caused me to not complete things in a timely manner like I would like. Upon these reflections I had already started to reorganize my time and the readings in this activity has just allowed me to build upon and improve my current systems. I spent the most time researching the pomodoro technique ( a form of time boxing), some counterintuitive ways to be productive, understanding flow and finding my own rhythm, and meditation. I will find ways to incorporate pieces of each of these into my efforts.

One of the most important things I had to realize was my own personal rhythm and how and when I work best. I've noticed that I have become more of a morning person, generally waking up at the same time each day without the help of an alarm. This is time before my wife has waken up and allows me to get started on work without distraction. It was also important for me to understand, that even though I wake up early, I generally do not like getting right to work to be the first thing I undertake. I like to get acclimated to my day so I have started praying and meditating first when I get up in morning. This allows me to center myself, reflect quietly on my day ahead, and as I read increase beta waves in my brain and allow it to process more information. Once that is complete I feel ready to move ahead with my day. This is something I plan to investigate more over the course of the day to better understand what times my mind works best and is able to remain the most focused at a given task.

In understanding that although I may schedule an activity for an hour and a half or two hours, I may not be able to work at it straight through for the entirety of that time. This means time blocking will be very important for me. Something I looked more into and want to incorporate are pieces of the pomodoro technique, especially the 25 minutes on task 5 minutes on another task. It will help because my mind can easily wander to other ideas and interest, so doing things in shorter burst and give my mind a short bit of time to work on something else really helps. It also mentioned to write down ideas or things that may pop into my head during the 25 minutes so that I am not still consumed with it because I gave it some immediate attention, but still allows me to stay on task and revisit it later. Some other things that stood out to me that will be really helpful is accurately figuring out how many pomodoros (or time blocks) an activity will take, keeping outside distractions away while focusing on an activity, making accurate estimations of how much time or how many pomodoros an activity will take ( something I need to work at), and setting aside some time in the 25 minutes for recap of what I previously did and review of what I just finished. There were also many suggestions of things I can do during the 5 minutes, many of which are things that I would want to do like cleaning, organizing some other things, perhaps sending out some emails, getting up to move around and do a little exercise, and even revisiting some of the ideas I wrote out earlier.

Another article that really spoke to me was about counterintuitive ways to be productive. It talked about realizing that I am not a machine and I can’t expect myself to function as one just moving through task after task, but that we do things in cycles and seasons, and it will help if I can embrace that. I can't be afraid of starting my day with things I want to do or will be proud of accomplishing. Procrastination is a defense against doing things we don’t want to do and accomplishing things we want can help motivate us to get started. This is an expansion off the pomodoro technique, but breaking things down into even smaller bits to help keep me motivated and seeing some things completed will greatly help. I've noticed that the feeling of accomplishment gives me more motivation to keep working and making the task smaller makes them less overwhelming. I plan to figure out how I can make task more interesting or challenging for me to help engage me deeper into the task. This is help keep me engage and get into that flow I mentioned earlier. Lastly is something I never did but can really help with my emotional state as things become more rigorous. I must be sure to focus on how I feel about getting through task rather than just on finishing them. Putting all the focus on finishing puts too much unnecessary attention simply on finishing and is something that may keep me in a fixed mindset. I also need to focus on how a I feel about my growth and be proud of what I am learning and accomplishing.

I believe if I can continue to incorporate these techniques and suggestions into my work flow I will be creating a path to success for myself not only in this program, but for every other future endeavor in my life.

##The Command Line

The shell is the more efficient interface used to navigate the file structure and processes on the computer. It was designed to navigate a unix system decades ago and has withstood the test of time for being a more direct method for interacting with your system. It is very customizable and the settings are controlled in your bash proflie. One of the things that makes the shell so preferred is the ability to manipulate the way it behaves to simplify your workflow allowing for less information to have to be repeatedly typed into your terminal. You can also execute processes in the shell program just like you would another program like ruby. The shell also allows for you to interact with hidden files and options you would not be able to navigate to through your user interface.

One of the largest obstacles going through this material was understanding and trying to remember all the different commands and linking them to when you will need to utilize them. The various amount of operations one can perform through the shell is simultaneously enlightening and overwhelming. Practicing with and actually utilizing these commands helped greatly with my understanding and memorization of what they do. I luckily did not run into any problems running the commands I saw in the material. I had a little trouble doing the alias and function commands, but after researching the exact syntax for how it was to be written, it worked just fine. I understand vi, the virtual interface command, but I am still a bit confused about navigating inside of it. I looked at the help file within it, which offered some help, but did not tell me all I wanted to know about what to press in order to enter information into the text file and how to exit that so that I can exit the vi altogether. This was one of the commands shown in the video quite a few times, but was not explained how to navigate it. You just see the instructor using it. Thankfully, again with some quick research online I was able to find the necessary commands I needed to know to insert, exit insert, and exit with saving the file.

This video contained a lot of information, some of which was difficult to fully grasp, but it helped to provide a good foundation. Through this and my other studies I believe the most important commands to be cd, pwd, mkdir, ls, grep, vi, cat, and man. Using the shell is foundationally navigating through directories which means you must know how to navigate through them. Thats why cd, pwd, and mkdir are so important because to need to be able to navigate to a directory, know what directory you are in, and create a new directory if needed. In the same idea, ls is important because you will always need to see what files and directories are within the directory you are using or plan to use so you can navigate and work with the correct file. When working in an environment without a robust and polished user interface search is very valuable, thus the grep command being so useful. Once a file is found, you will need to see what the contents are and using the cat command to print them out is a great way to do that. With the shell being all about efficiency the vi command is a necessity. With most of our work being creating code to be run by a program, it is invaluable to have an editor right within the shell without having to exit and open another program to create or edit a file. And lastly man, which will give you detailed information about every command. Often times we will not remember exactly what a command does or what are all the options that accompany it, but this command allows us to easily access that information.

- pwd: print working directory will print to the console the path for the directory you are currently in.
- ls: list will list all the files in a directory
- mv: move will allow you to move a file from one directory to another
- cd: change directory will allow you to navigate to a specific directory
- ../: this represents the next directory up in the file tree.
- touch: touch creates a new file in your working directory
- mkdir: make directory creates a new directory within your working directory
- less: prints out one page at a time for viewing
- rmdir: remove directory deletes the directory
- rm: remove deletes the file
- help: and help will give you helpful information on the shell or whatever other program you are accessing within the shell.

##Forking and Cloning

- Creating a new repository
  - GitHub
    - Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the plus sign in the upper right hand corner of the screen. This is “Create new”
    - Click it and you will see a drop down with one of the options being “New Repository.”
    - Click on “New Repository.”
    - A new page should appear with some options for creating your new repository.
    - The first thing to look for is a text field in the top center of the screen labeled “Repository Name”
    - Type the name of the repository in that box.
    - There are some other options you can adjust such as “Public” or “Private.” Public will allow you to easily share your repositories and let people see your work. Private will make that you can only see it and will have to intentionally share with others.
    - Once you are done looking through all your options click “Create Repository” and you are all done.
  -Command Line
    - Navigate to the directory where you want your repository to reside.
    - Type in git init <repository name> and hit enter
    - You new repository should be created.
- Forking
  - Forking is a GitHub term for copying a repository. Forking is beneficial in that it allows you to copy all of the contents in a repository in one action.
  - Navigate to the repository you want fork
  - Look in the upper right hand corner of the screen for “Fork” and click on “Fork.”
  - You should now see a new screen with the repository copied into your GitHub account.
- Cloning
  - Cloning is the Git term for copying a repository
  - Navigate to the directory where you want your repository to reside.
  - Type in git clone <repository location> and hit enter
  - You new repository should be created.
  - This works for repositories stored locally as well as online on sites like GitHub
- I did not have any problems setting up Git or GitHub. It all seemed pretty straight forward. The sight was intuitive and the commands using Git were fairly straight forward. I did had some questions conceptually, but mainly around branching and merging, but I’m sure I will learn more about that as I move on. I did learn that version control is very important and that it is simple to copy a directory so that you can work on it without worry of damaging the main or “master” repository.
