###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a repository is similar to creating a folder on your computer and creating one on the GitHub site is very simple. If you've created things on other websites (like a facebook page) you will be able to create a repository on GitHub.

- Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the plus sign in the upper right hand corner of the screen. This is “Create new”
- Click it and you will see a drop down with one of the options being “New Repository.”
- Click on “New Repository.”
- A new page should appear with some options for creating your new repository.
- The first thing to look for is a text field in the top center of the screen labeled “Repository Name”
- Type the name of the repository in that box.
- There are some other options you can adjust such as “Public” or “Private.” Public will allow you to easily share your repositories and let people see your work. Private will make that you can only see it and will have to intentionally share with others.
- Once you are done looking through all your options click “Create Repository” and you are all done.

Now cloning it to your computer may be a little more confusing. You'll need to open this program called terminal (if you're on a mac) that's located in your application folder in the utilities folder. This program let's you talk directly to the computer by typing in commands. Follow these following instructions and you should be just fine.

- When you open terminal you should first see some words that will include your login name and probably in with a dollar sign ($).
- Navigate to the directory, or folder, where you want your repository to reside by typing in cd, which means change directory, and the folder path to get there. You can also do this by opening finder, finding the folder, and clicking and dragging it into terminal. This will automatically enter the path. Now hit enter.
- Once a new line appears type in git clone <repository location> , which is the website address given to you on GitHub where you created the repository,and hit enter.
- You new repository should be created.
- This works for repositories stored locally as well as online on sites like GitHub


###Describe what open source means.

Open source means fudamentally that some software or piece of code is somewhat unprotected by copyright law for the benefit of other developers to use the code or software at no cost, build upon it and change the software, and distribute it out to others as they please. This allows many people, especially those how are passionate about it, to work on and develop the software for the betterment of everyone.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I really like the idea of open source. I think it is really beneficial for foundational softwares and codes that can be implemented in many different technologies. It allow us to progress forward faster with worrying about licensing cost or that company or person even following up on the design of it. Anyone can help progress it forward. This doesn't mean I think everything should be open source, because I feel giving people incentive by allowing them to protect and ultimately make money off of their ideas is good incentive. I do believe it has it's place and depending on your business model can be very profitable as well. Look at Android and Wordpress as shining examples.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are very important as they still provide a creator with some protection of their ideas, and I am glad licensing has become part of the open source world. This allows people who create code or software, or even other things, to share it with the world, but still create some rules and guidelines as to how they would like this to happen. It protects them, can protect the people using the code, and can create a culture of people open sourcing things for future people to iterate on. It is also great that there are different type of license with different rules to allow different people to operate the way that makes them feel most comfortable.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Using git and GitHub to create, clone, fork, push, pull, and merge branches was really solidified with this lesson and I'm noticing that this will be a practice for all of our lessons. I belive that practice makes perfect and repetition always helps. I did not have any struggles, but I know I will have to read more and internalize more if I want to undertand more about and the difference between different licenses.

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

If I find more resources about licensing I will list it here.
