###What does puts do?
Puts prints the output of whatever is written behind it to the terminal and prints it to a new line.

###What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number like 4 , 679, or 9482736. It has no decimal places. A float is a number with decimals like 1.4, 34.687, or 0.938475.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division will return a float answer while integer division will return and integer. Float division is just like the division on a calculator giving you a precise answer to the decimal place. Integer division will round down if it cannot give you the correct answer. It is good for things that can't be broken up into pieces. For example if a hat is $6 and you have $20, you can only by 3 hats, not 3.333 hats.

###How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles all these math processes just as a calculator would, but you can also assign numbers to variables and use them in your equations.

###What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
String can be letters, words, phrase, or even numbers contained between two "" or ''. You can print a string to the terminal.

###What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables contain values, such as numbers and strings, that can be used within various methods or functions. It allows you to reuse a value over and over again without having to rewrite every time. You can also manipulate and change the values of local variables.

###How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This was a good review. Most of it was pretty basic and I had remembered all of it, but it also introduce a few new concepts that I had not previously learned. Rspec is a completely new concept.
