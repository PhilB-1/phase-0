<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [1] hours. -->
<!--
What did you learn about the DOM?
I learned how you can use the DOM with javascript, not just html and css, to affect the css and html. This can be very helpful in changing one thing and not having to go all throughout your code to make a change.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
Some of the most helpful methods are the ones to access a portion of your html code by tag, ID, or class. They are getElementByID, getElementsByClass, and getElementsByTag.
