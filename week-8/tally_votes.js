What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
I learned that the for loop in JS is very similar to using the each method in Ruby. I also learned that when iterating through nested objects it is really important to console.log what you are iterating through to understand exactly what place you are at. It is also important to see the diferrence between accessing a nested object, finding the property in that nested object, and accessing the value in that nested object.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
No really. The best method we used was the for loop.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
Iterating using for loops and accessing nested objects.
