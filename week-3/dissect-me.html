    <h3>What is the difference between padding, border, and margin?<h3>
    <p>These are three options that directly interact with one another and the content. It is best to understand these different elements by utilizing the imagery that shows eaches circle of influence. Padding is the space between you content and the border and is best used in creating space around your content, especially within the border. The border is good for differentiating separate elements and even within an element. It can be used to make tables or buttons for your site and just creating differentiation between the different spaces on your site. Margin is space around the border and is great for creating space between elements, as well as assisting with position around the page. In positioning you can also use negative numbers to move your content in the opposite direction. Having the image with color coded outlines in Chrome DevTools really help to utilize padding, borders, and margin and see how your design is changing as you change the options. It also helps to see which is probably your best bet to change in order to have the desired effect.</p>

    <h3>What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?</h3>
    <p>I always use the basic layout using the doctype, head, title, html, and body tags so now having them as a tab command is really helpful. I also used this challenge and use often are the header, article, p, and h1, h2, and h3 tags. When writting informatin and classify importance of your headers, these p and h tags are invaluable. The header and article tag also allow me to better organize my code and more easily see what informatin should be where.</p>

    <h3>How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?</h3>
    <p>Elements in your html get laid out in sequential order (the same in which they were put on the page). The element at the top will be the first element and the element at the bottom will be the last. You will have to use CSS to start to rearrange the placement of these elements.</p>

    <h3>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?</h3>
    <p>I learned that not only does Sublime have tons of great built in auto-complete methods and snippets use shorthand to do larger task, but you can create your own. I think now that I know this exist and know how to create them, I will definitely make more. I just need to study my workflow to see what will be the most beneficial. I also think I would be cheating myself to not look up what other built short-cuts there are. They people who created this program obviously have more experience than me in coding and would have thought up some great ways to improve their workflow.</p>
