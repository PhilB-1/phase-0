- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great to put our learning into practice and recreate an actual site. I thought it was a great test of our beginner skills, and the site offered just enough challenge to make the project interesting and engaging.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was very interesting to understand how semantic elements have changed with different versions of HTML and how expanisve it has become in the new version. I think it helps in organizing our code as well as making it much better for readers.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think my pair and I did well to keep to best practices. I'm not sure if our use of tables was best practice to create the columns for the links, but it was a good challenge and a great way to understand how to combine different tags to accomplish a goal.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think html is great at letting a developer create a structure of a page. It is fairly clear and straight foward and allows someone to easily program a page. I think the downside is that you can tell it was not originally created to do what we use it for, namely create websites, which means you must really on other languages like CSS and Javascript for style and functionality to allow websites to perform the task we want them to.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Memorizing the basic structure and common tags, as well as how to nest them. I also keep resources and notes of tags that I can easily reference.
